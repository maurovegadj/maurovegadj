I am looking to learn more about the Gibhub community what work is like and how to get more knowledge and information about software development
I am also interested in an audio production system in the area of techno music, since they always create new changes or trends that affect all music.
As a DJ, producer and owner of the record label it is important to be in contact with new trends.
Thanks
